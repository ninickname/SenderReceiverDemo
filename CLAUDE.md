# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This is a new IntelliJ IDEA project named "SenderReceiverDemo" that currently contains only IDE configuration files. No source code, build configuration, or documentation has been created yet.

## Project Setup

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA project
- **Project Type**: General module (no specific framework detected)
- **Structure**: Empty project ready for development

## Development Notes

Since this is an empty project, future development will likely involve:
- Adding source code structure (src/main/java, etc.)
- Configuring build system (Maven with pom.xml or Gradle with build.gradle)
- Setting up appropriate package structure for sender/receiver demo functionality

Update this file once the project structure and build system are established.
